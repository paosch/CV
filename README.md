# Paola Schiaffino
After two language degrees and more than ten years of working as a professional translator, I plunged into coding. I am now a full-stack junior software developer. I needed a new and challenging career and I am positive that coding will give me the opportunity to create exciting things.

I have just finished my course at Makers Academy and I am now looking for a role where I can expand my programming skills and knowledge. I would like to work in a diverse and international environment with the support of people who follow the best coding practices.

## Skills

#### Excellent communication skills
- When I lived in Madrid I volunteered to teach adult immigrants to speak Spanish. Soon after I started, the person who was teaching them literacy left. The course coordinator allowed me to take over because he believed the way I communicate with people overcomes language and cultural barriers. The students' response was extremely good and this led to the organisation offering me to take on the role permanently.
- When I was working as a translator for Durrants, I was promoted to deputy team leader. The team included people with strong and conflicting personalities. Effective communication helped me build a good rapport with all of them and proved essential when it came to delegating: I was able to tailor my approach and get the best response from each member of the team. This created a pleasant working environment and helped us work together to reach team objectives such as meeting delivery deadlines and sending a large number of translations to coustomers.

#### Commitment
I completed a two-year astronomy course, as well as the first year of a BSc in Astronomy degree as a remote student, all while doing an unrelated full-time job. I had no science background, but with lots of hard work, discipline and focus I was able to teach myself and reach the level of maths and physics required to succeed in the course. 

#### Teamwork
- I am a great collaborator and easily adapt to my role in a team. In my last job, my boss and team mates praised my positive influence and saw it as crucial to the success of our team projects. My enthusiasm, contribution, hard work, and the ability to create a pleasant working atmosphere for the team were mentioned in my yearly appraisals both by managers and colleagues. Last Christmas I was working as a translator in Cision and we were short of staff. I took on a great amount of extra work (the deputy team leader's coordination, delivery and translation tasks as well as another colleague's translation tasks. We still managed to meet the deadlines and targets and there were no customer complaints.  
- In Makers Academy, I have been thanked several times through our communication channel for good pair-programming 

#### Attention to detail
I have a good eye for detail, I often notice small things that other people fail to see. I developed this useful skill during my entire translation career. I have always edited my work thoroughly in order to provide customers with the highest-quality translation possible.
