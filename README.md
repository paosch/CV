# Paola Schiaffino
After two language degrees and more than ten years of working as a professional translator, I plunged into coding. I needed a new and challenging career and I am positive that coding will give me the opportunity to create exciting things.

I have been studying at Makers Academy to become a competent and confident junior developer. I am now looking for a role where I can expand my programming skills and knowledge. I would like to work in a diverse and international environment with people who follow the best coding practices. 

## Skills

#### Communication
My excellent communication skills allow me to make the most of situations that involve people of different backgrounds and/or personalities:
- I quickly settled in London when I came from a country which is 7,000 miles away
- As a volunteer in Madrid, I successfully taught adults how to write: they were in a vulnerable situation and spoke no Spanish or English at all. Their progress has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever gone through
- When in charge of a team of translators, my effective communication skills proved crucial when delegating tasks to people of different (and conflicting) personalities, and made it possible for the team to reach targets and meet deadlines. 

#### Commitment
I completed a two-year astronomy course, as well as the first year of a BSc in Astronomy degree as a remote student, all while doing an unrelated full-time job. I had no science background, but with lots of hard work, discipline and focus I was able to teach myself and reach the level of maths and physics required to succeed in the course. 

#### Teamwork
- I am a great collaborator and easily adapt to my role in a team. In my last job, my boss and team mates praised my positive influence and saw it as crucial to the success of our team projects. My enthusiasm, contribution, hard work, and the ability to create a pleasant working atmosphere for the team was mentioned in my yearly appraisals both by managers and colleagues
- In Makers Academy, I have been thanked several times through our communication channel for good pair programming 

#### Attention to detail
I have a good eye for detail and often notice small things that other people fail to see. I developed this useful skill during my translation career. I have always edited my work thoroughly in order to give customers the highest-quality translation possible.
