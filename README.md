# Paola Schiaffino

After two language degrees and more than ten years of working as a professional translator, I plunged into coding. I needed a new and challenging career and I believe that coding will give me the opportunity to create exciting things.

I have been studying at Makers Academy, where I hope to become a competent and confident junior developer. I would like to work in a diverse and international environment with people who follow the best coding practices and where I can expand my programming skills and knowledge with their support.

## Skills

#### Communication
My excellent communication skills allow me to make the most of situations that involve people of different backgrounds and nationalities. Thanks to these skills, I quickly settled in London when I came from a country which is 7,000 miles away, and I've been a good teacher (when I lived in Madrid for example, I successfully taught adults how to write; they spoke no Spanish or English at all). In my previous translation job, when I was in charge of a team of translators, my effective communication skills made it possible for us to work together to reach our targets and meet deadlines. I was also the one in charge of communicating with content providers in other countries due to my effective approach when dealing with them.

#### Commitment
I completed a two-year astronomy course (pass mark 85%) and did the first year of a BSc in Astronomy degree as a remote student, all while doing an unrelated full-time job. I had no science background, but with a great degree of hard work, discipline and focus I was able to reach the level of maths and physics required to succeed in the course.

#### Team player
I adapt easily to my role in a team. In my last job, my boss and team mates praised my positive influence and saw it as crucial to the success of our team projects. My enthusiasm, contribution, hard work, and the ability to create a pleasant working atmosphere for the team was mentioned in my yearly appraisals both by managers and colleagues.

#### Attention to detail
I have a good eye for detail and often notice small things that other people do not see. I developed this skill in translation jobs, where I have always had to edit my work thoroughly in order to give customers the highest-quality translation possible.
